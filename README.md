This story map goes across the high desert of Southeastern Oregon. I choose this region
because I am interested in geographic features. I have organized my storymap to show
features going from west to east. These areas out east are important locations for
many species of flora and fauna. The land out here is part of the Basin and Range
complex which covers most of Nevada. The economy out here relies on agriculture and recreation.
